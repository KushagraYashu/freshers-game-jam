  - Hey?
  - Can you hear me dumbass?
  - Good.
  - Listen up, 'cause you're about to have the worst ride of your sorry life.
  - You're stuck in that death trap of an elevator.
  - It's gonna take you up floor by floor,
  - but don't get too comfortable -
  - you're not alone in there.
  - Zombies are just the start.
  - Up ahead?
  - Well, let's just say there are things worse than zombies.
  - Unimaginable horrors, freakshows straight outta your nightmares.
  - You'll find out soon enough.
  - You get to the top.
  - Maybe you make it out alive.
  - Maybe.
  - Your goal?
  - Simple.
  - Don't Die.
  - Oh, and don't bother looking for an escape button -
  - there isn't one.
  - Fight or die, that's it.
  - Remember, every time those doors open,
  - whatever's out there want to tear you apart.
  - So grab whatever you can, shoot straight, and don't waste time.
  - You hesitate for even a second, and you're done.
  - Floor after floor, it's just you versus them.
  - Good luck, champ.
  - Not that it's gonna help you.
